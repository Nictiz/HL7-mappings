* Entry point text: Description: The R_Subject CMET is intended to be used where a more generalized subject or record target is needed in an order, result, document etc. Itâ€™s a choice of the preexisting R_Patient CMETs and the new R_InvestigativeSubject CMET, which is an investigative subject which is played by an E_PublicHealthEntity. This allows the simple inclusion of entities of interest for public health messaging into existing messages just by replacing the existing R_Patient CMET with this new R_Subject CMET as the subject, recordTarget or other participant.
